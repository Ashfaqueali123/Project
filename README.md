# Project
This C++ project includes three main features: a basic calculator, temperature converter and distance unit converter. Each feature is implemented using separate classes.
The calculator performs simple arithmetic operations, while the converters handle temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit) and distance (km, m) conversions.
